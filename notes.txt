1.DBMS Understanding?


Database Systems

a.Database 
	
	a1. Structured Database: which has some structure
	
ex: Employee,irctc,Flight booking,flipkart,banking,telecome,helathcare

               a2.Unstructured Database: which has no structure

ex: Webpage
text,hypetr,audio,video,animations






What is a Database?

Abhsishek has a good database of Automibiles

Abhsishek has a good information of Automibiles

ModelNo,Price,yearofmanufactir,colours,fuel type






b.DBMS: a software that manages the database

Oracle,Mysql,Postgres,SqlServer


How do  i store this databases in dbms?

Database are mainted in the form of a table


What is a table?

consists of data in the form of rows and columns where rows are nothing but data and colulms are nothibg but attributes.
At the end we manage a relational data ie structured data ie relational database management system



How do we manage the data or perform set of operations on the database?

DBMS provides a language called SQL.

2.SQL : IS A LANGUAGE USED TO PERFORM SET OF OPERATION ON STRUCTURED DATA.


How should we start with SQL.



1. Know the datatypes of that respective dbms?

Oracle

Character Based Data types: ' '

1.char:best uses for single aplhpabet storage

2.varchar:its not a varaiable length data type,2000 character
Ex: varchar(20):it will create a space for 20 character----space will be fixed for 2o character wheatger used or not

3.varchar2:its  a varaiable length data type,4000 characters
Ex: varchar2(20):it will create a space for 20 character--->space will be created only for the number of character stored.



4.nchar:its not a varaiable length data type,used for storing encoding charcter formats.
NLS format---->National Language Specfication


5.nvarchar2:its  a varaiable length data type
NLS format---->National Language Specfication


Numeric Data Types
number(p,s):
p-precision
s-size
number(s);

float: large fractional values

int: not physical available in oracle



Date Data Types
date: stores data moth year hours minutes secs
timsestamp:stores data moth year hours minutes secs fsec




Advanced Data Types
blob: 4gb of data,binary hexadecimal format,it can store all type of formats,jpeg,gif,png,doc,pdf,text
clob:2gb of data,text format



raw: hexadecimal value,32575,0-9 & a-f

raw('8999jkil');


long: numerical value

long(123566);'123456'



Ex:

ename,eid,salary,designation
10
10
10
10


2. Know the SQL Commands

DDL: ANY OPERATIONS INVOLVED WITH THE STRUCTURE
1.create,alter,rename,truncate,drop

DML:ANY OPERATIONS INVOLVED WITH THE Data
1.insert,update,delete,select

DCL:ANY OPERATIONS INVOLVED WITH THE Prvilages/Permisiion
grant,revoke

TCL:ANY OPERATIONS INVOLVED WITH THE DB Transaction
commit,rollback,savepoint

3.Know the Operators.

Arithmetic Operators: +,-,*,/,%
Assignment Operators:=
Relational Operators: <,<=,>=,==,!=

Logical Operators: AND,OR,NOT,IN,BETWEEN,LIKE,IS NULL, 


Advanced Operators:

SET,UNION,UNIOALLINTERSECT,MINUS



Know about Data Integerity Management?

Constraints.

Primary Key: no duplicates and null values allowed ie ( Unique+Not null)


Unique key: no duplicates
Not null:no null
Check: to apply some range,or the format of data


create table employee(empid number check(empid between 50 and 2000),name varchar2(20),age number not null check(age >=18));


Default
foriegn key




****************************************************************************************************************************


Delete: used for partial and complete deleteion
its slower
rollback can be done to retrive data baack


Truncate: used for complete deletion
its fast
rollback will not work





Drop: used for deleteing the table or removing the table

we can recove the table by using advacnced dml commands called  flashback




























Functions in Oracle:

Numeric Functions: abs(),ceil(),floor(),round(),power(),truunc()

String functions:length(),lower(),upper(),substr(),instr(),lpad(),rpad()


Date Functions: sysdate,add_months(),last_day(),next_day(),months_between(),current_date;

Conversion functions:to_char,to_date
Multi Row Functions(Aggregate functions):MIN,MAX,SUM,COUNT,AVG


Clauses.: help us to sort the data based on some condition
where
order by
group by
having
fetch first
fetch last
